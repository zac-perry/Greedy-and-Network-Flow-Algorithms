/*
2. Network Flow: Write an algorithm in a language of your choice that takes as input
a flow network in modified DIMACS format and prints all flow augmenting paths.
Ensure infinite looping isnâ€™t possible. I will try to break your code.
Ex. File (tab separated values)

5 6
0 1 4
0 2 3
0 3 5
1 4 7
2 4 18
3 4 6

The first row is the vertex count and then the arc count
The remaining rows are the arcs: vertex 1, vertex 2, and arc weight
0 will always be the source vertex, and the vertex with the largest id will always
be the sink. In the above example that makes 0 the source and 4 the sink.
